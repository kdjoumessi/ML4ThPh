## Machine Learning for Theoretical Physicists (ML4ThPh)
This repository contains the code for my project titled, __A Machine learning classification model for maize crops affected by fall armyworm__. This project was done at the end of the six months online program on Machine Learning for Theoretical Physicists 2021-2022.

This project is based on the Zindi competition titled [Makerere Fall Armyworm Crop Challenge](https://zindi.africa/competitions/makerere-fall-armyworm-crop-challenge) and the corresponding dataset can be easily downloaded. 

In this project, we used PyTorch to build a classification Computer vision model to determine if maize crops have been affected by the fall armyworm pest. We also use a Saliency Map technique (GradCAM) to highlight the relevant regions on the input image that may have guided the classification output.
